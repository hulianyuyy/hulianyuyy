### HiðŸ‘‹, i'm a PhD candidate (2021.09-now) in Tianjin University, China. My major interests include video understanding, sign language understanding and multi-modal learning. I'd like to let the people benefit more from general computer vision techniques. For more information, please visit www.hulianyu.top. Feel free to contact me via hly2021@tju.edu.cn.

### Newsâœ‰:
- We release **AdaptSign**, a CSLR model powered by frozen pretrained image models with **18.5%** & **18.8%** WER on phoenix2014, **18.6%** & **19.8%** WER on phoenix2014-T, **26.7%** & **26.3% WER** on CSL-Daily.

- We release ***DSTA-SLT**, which performs SLR with ***pure skeleton inputs*** but ahcieves comparable accuracy and much faster speed than recognition with RGB inputs.
