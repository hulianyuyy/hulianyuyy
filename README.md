### HiðŸ‘‹, i'm a PhD candidate (2021.09-now) in Tianjin University, China. My major interests include video understanding, sign language understanding and multi-modal learning. I'd like to let the people benefit more from general computer vision techniques. For more information, please visit www.hulianyu.top. Feel free to contact me via hly2021@tju.edu.cn.

### âœ‰ News:
- We release [**CorrNet+**](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/CorrNet_Plus), an unified model with superior performance on both **continuous sign language recognition** and **sign language translation** tasks by using **only RGB inputs**.

- We release [**AdaptSign**](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/AdaptSign), a CSLR model powered by frozen pretrained image models with **18.5%** & **18.8%** WER on phoenix2014, **18.6%** & **19.8%** WER on phoenix2014-T, **26.7%** & **26.3%** WER on CSL-Daily.

- We release [**DSTA-SLR**](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/DSTA-SLR), which performs sign language recognition (SLR) with **pure skeleton inputs** but ahcieves comparable accuracy and much faster speed than recognition with RGB inputs.
